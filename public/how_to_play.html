<h1>How to Play</h1>

<p>The game starts when you are stuck inside the cursed mines after an earthquake blocked the entrance. <br>
Your only chance of survival is reaching level 5 attack spell - with it you can crush the boulders, shatter them into pebbles and escape. <br>

The mines start with some population of monsters, and <strong>every 45 seconds a new monster is added</strong>. You will hear a sound when a new monster is added.<br>
Each time, <strong>the new monster is randomly more powerful</strong> than the previous ones. You better escape quickly or you will be overwhelmed eventually.</p>

<p>You have few spells at your disposal:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Power blast</strong> -  a powerful attack spell</li>
    <li><strong>Shield</strong> - cast a defensive shield around you.</li>
    <li>More later...</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The spells start at level 1, which is enough to harm the weaker monsters, but will barely tickle the more powerful ones that will arrive
    as the game progresses.
    </p>

<h2>Advancing the Spell levels</h2>
<i><strong>Sorry</strong></i> the section below was my plans - but I ran out of time and instead gave levels 1-3 at the begining without any ability
to get levels 4-5... so there is no way to win the game - just survive as long as you can. <br>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><p>You can learn a new spell level by acquiring one of the lost magic pages.
However, this isn't so easy - the magic pages are hidden and show themselves only to the most worthy of heroes. <br>
You must prove yourself worthy before a magic page will appear - and the more powerful pages may be most difficult to find. </p>
<p>After <strong>5 consecutive successful attacks</strong> of the <strong>highest level</strong> you have, you will be deemed
    worthy to learn the next level, and a new magic page will appear somewhere. <br>
Touch the magic page and you will instantly learn its secrets - and a new spell level will become available.</p></span>

<h2>Moving</h2>
<p>Simple, you move using the arrow keys. Use shift+[arrow] to walk, but there is no reason to walk, so don't do it. <br>
    In the future walk vs run will have tactical differences (eg. walk to sneak behind monsters) but not yet.</p>

<h2>Casting</h2>
<p>Press <strong>A</strong> to cast an <strong>a</strong>ttack, and press <strong>S</strong> to cast a <strong>s</strong>hield. <br>
You can only attack while an enemy is within range, but can shield at any time. Attempting to cast attack with no enemy in range will display the range.<br>
When you are casting mini-games will display above you - <strong>getting them correct will successfully cast the spell</strong>,
    getting them wrong will fail the spell. See the section below about mini-games to learn how to play them.</p>
<p>Remember - higher level spells are significantly more powerful, but also their mini-games are more difficult. <br>

You can use the <strong>Q</strong> or <strong>1</strong> buttons to cycle between levels of attack spell,<br>
    and the <strong>W</strong> or <strong>2</strong> buttons to cycle between levels of shield spell.</p>

<p>The attack spell will automatically target one of the enemies in range. Press <stong>Z</stong> to <strong>cycle targets</strong> if more than one is in range. <br>
You can see the current target by the ellipse that will appear below it.
</p>

<p>While you are casting you <strong>use the arrow keys</strong> to play the mini-games (see explanation below). <br>
Press <strong>Space bar</strong> to finish casting, or press the casting button (ie. A or S) again.</p>

<h2>Mini-Games</h2>
<h3>Mental Math mini-game</h3>
<p>Your task is to choose the <strong>smaller</strong> mathematical expression, using the arrow keys. <br>
    Press <strong>Left</strong> arrow if the smaller expression is on the left, and press <strong>Down</strong> arrow if both expressions are equal.</p>
